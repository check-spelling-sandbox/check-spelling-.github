This especially includes [forks](#forks) and [demos](#demo-repositories).

### Supported Versions

In general, this is the matrix of supported versions for supported repositories (excluding any [forks](#forks)):

| Version          | Supported          |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `main`           | :white_check_mark: |

## Unsupported Repositories

### Forks

:information_source: If a repository is a [:fork_and_knife:fork](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories?type=fork), it is probably not supported and shouldn't be used for production systems.

:fork_and_knife:Forks are generally used to test [check-spelling/check-spelling](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling) and [check-spelling/spell-check-this](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/).

### Demo repositories

This includes:
* [example](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories?q=example&type=source) repositories
* [test](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories?q=test&type=source) repositories
* repositories named for other vendors (typically to demonstrate/test check-spelling against their software)

## Security Notices

and possibly a [CVE](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories#cve-identification-numbers).
