## Supported Software

Most repositories owned by [this organization](../../../) are [not supported software](#unsupported-repositories).
Especially [demos](#demo-repositories).

Potentially supported repositories are limited to a subset of [source repositories](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories?q=&type=source) (again, excluding [demos](#demo-repositories)).

### Supported Versions

In general, this is the matrix of supported versions for supported repositories (excluding any [forks](#forks)):

| Version          | Supported          |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `main`           | :white_check_mark: |
| _latest release_ | :white_check_mark: |
| `prerelease`     | :speech_balloon:   |
| `*`              | :x:                |

## Unsupported Repositories

### Demo repositories

This includes:
* [example](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories?q=example&type=source) repositories
* [test](https://github.com/orgs/check-spelling/repositories?q=test&type=source) repositories
* repositories named for other vendors (typically to demonstrate/test check-spelling against their software)
